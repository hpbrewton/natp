<li>Groups 1 &amp; 2
<ul>
<li>The “old-style stuff”, as one rancher describes it was to turn the cattle loose, and the ranchers would let come what may to the riparian areas</li>
<li>The old style worked insofar that the cattle were able to be self sufficient, and that the ranchers were able “to forget what they were doing there”</li>
<li>Repeated and almost uninterrupted grazing prevented plant populations from recovering.</li>
<li>The traditional way of measuring usage, and thus preventing damage, was to look at stubble height. Stubble height, however, does not take into account repeated damage</li>
<li>Measuring riparian converge seemed to be better method of measurement</li>
<li>Ranchers have adopted rotating between and within allotments to reduce this pressure</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Group 3
<ul>
<li>A fish of primary focus has been the Lahontan cutthroat trout</li>
<li>Lahotan fish are able to survive in more Alkaline environments than other fish</li>
<li>The Nevada Department of Wildlife has led the preservation effort, they are aided by BLM and USFS.</li>
<li>There is an aim to create 10 new populations of LCT, make five of them strong populations</li>
<li>There is also an aim to increase angling opportunities</li>
<li>Also to prevent the crossbreeding of LCT and rainbow trout populations</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Group 4
<ul>
<li>The beavers have responded to increased vegetation by repopulating the watershed</li>
<li>Beavers have contributed to a virtuous cycle of increased vegetation</li>
<li>Beavers can impede water flow which harms irrigation</li>
<li>Beavers’ impedance can also create pools for drinking from</li>

<li>The idea is just keep beavers away form culverts with gates and replants</li>
